# A brief prehisory of control theory

## Introduction

Hello and welcome to *inControl*, the first podcast on control theory. Here we discuss the science of feedback, decision making, artificial intelligence, and much more. I'm your host Alberto Paduan live from the recording studio at ETH ZÃ¼rich. This podcast is supported by the National Center of Competence in Research on dependable Ubiquitous Automation.

Today's episode breaks the ice with the history of control theory. We will dig into the roots of the science of feedback. We will discuss some of the most iconic
ancestors of control.

First we're going to talk about water clocks developed by Ctesibius, a Greek inventor and mathematician who lived in the 3rd century BC and whose fame at the time rivaled out of a genius-like archimedes. then we're going to talk about the earliest known thermostat which was originally designed by a dutch alchemist in the 17th century in an attempt to turn lead into gold. And finally we're going to talk about governors and i don't mean politicians here but a class of mechanical devices which without exaggeration have enabled the first industrial revolution in britain

## Ktesibios

our first story today concerns water clocks designed by tesibius he was an inventor who lived in alexandria in the ancient hellenistic state of ptolemaic egypt in the first half of the 3rd century bc very little is known about his life but what we do know is that he started his career as a barber tazibius had the natural talent for building mechanical devices of all sorts for example he invented a counterweight adjustable mirror to help customers appreciate his haircutting skills most of modern plumbing owes a lot to the zebus he is credited with creating the first pump about which he wrote a whole treatise a water organ and several kinds of catapults this talent didn't go unnoticed and led him to become a proper mechanism under king ptolemy ii

wikipedia lists tesibius as possibly the first head of the museum of alexandria the museum was one of the major cultural attractions in the mediterranean at the time it was literally the institution of the muses and so was the home of music poetry a philosophical school and a famous library which at the time was possibly the largest of the ancient world anyways at this stage you may wonder why should we be interested in tesibius's water clocks

well tasibas is credited with inventing the first automatic device exploiting feedback namely a self-regulating water clock you have to think that measuring time in ancient greece was no easy business in ancient times the sun was used to measure the time during the day but as the night approached sun dials weren't much help anymore so people around the world invented water clocks that used dripping water to mark the hours the idea was to measure the passage of time by means of a small trickle of water flowing into a tank as the water level rose an indicator riding on the water was used to measure time for this reason ancient greeks call their water clocks klepsidros which literally translates to water thief and comes from the fusion of kleptane to steel liking kleptomaniac and hudor water like in hydraulics the main problem with most water clocks was that the speed of emptying would gradually decrease as the reservoir of water propelling the drive mechanism emptied this is simply because a shallow level of water provides less pressure than a high level so effectively a clock would slow down as the reservoir of water emptied tessibius solved the problem of maintaining the trickle of water flowing at a constant rate by inventing a regulating valve that resembles those of modern carburetors the regulating valve comprised of a float in the shape of a cone which fit its nose into a mating inverted funnel within the regulating valve water flowed from the funnel stem over the cone and into the bowl where the cone swam in the cone would then float up into the concave funnel and constrict the water passage thus throttling its flow so as the water diminished the float would actually sink opening the passage again and allowing more water in the feedback mechanism implemented by the regulating valve would therefore automatically seek a compromised position it would let just enough water for a constant flow through the metering vault vessel perhaps the best way to understand this mechanism is to think about a curious heritage of tesibius's device which is a constant presence in most of our homes the flash toilet tessibius's floating vault is indeed the predecessor of the floating ball in the upper chamber of the porcelain throne after a flush the floating ball sinks with the declining water level pulling open the water valve with its metal arm the incoming water fills the vessel again raising the ball triumphantly so that its arm closes the flow of water at the precise level of full so every time you use a modern flash toilet think about the fact that it exploits an ingenious device which datesback to the 3rd century bc

## Cornelis Drebble

our second story today concerns one of the major yet invisible applications of control heating every day we regulate the temperature of our rooms via a basic device that we call the thermostat a device that was invented by the dutch alchemist cornelius rebel during the dutch golden age like the zebus rebel was a polymath by the time he built the first ever thermostat drebel was already regarded in europe as the thomas edison of his times he had already enchanted royalty with firework displays harpsichos that played on solar energy and even what is thought to be the first navigable submarine according to an account by francis bacon rebel invented the thermostat only incidentally while he pursued one of the highest goals of alchemy turning base metals like lead into noble metals like gold treble was born in 1572 in algmar a relatively small town in the north of holland after some years at the latin school in akhmar he attended the academy in harlem under the supervision of hendrick goldtus an engraver painter and alchemist who is said to have lost an eye in an alchemical experiment gone wrong drebel married one of gold's use's sisters and initially started his career working as a painter engraver and cartographer but he was in constant need of money because of the prodigal lifestyle of his wife around 1604 drebel and his family moved to england probably at the invitation of the new king james first the rebel quickly became a favorite entertainer at court with recurrent displays of his ingenious inventions like the perpetual motion clock which was able to tell the time date and season while being actuated only by atmospheric pressure and temperature drebel's inventions became so famous that rudolph ii the holy roman emperor invited him to prague on two occasions in 1610 and 1619 but the turbulent political situation in prague saw him arrested on both occasions and it was only through royal interventions from england that rebel managed to be released perhaps one of his coolest inventions was the first navigable submarine the so-called diving boat which he completed in 1620 it was basically a wooden vessel propelled by oars and sealed against the water by a covering of greased leather the diving boat was able to travel the river thames at a depth of 4 meters from westminster to greenwich treble was so confident about his invention that he even took the king on a test dive beneath the thames which makes king james first the first monarch to travel under water but let us go back to drebel's thermostat treble believed that he could achieve his alchemical goals if he only could keep the temperature of a furnace constant for a sufficiently long time with this goal in mind rebel created the first thermostat in the form of an l-shaped glass tube filled with alcohol that was topped off by mercury the mechanism by which the thermostat worked was very ingenious there was a metal rod floating in the quick silver so when the heated alcohol expanded it pushed up the quick silver and the rod rose in the tube the rising rod in turn pressed on a lever on which adjusted the size of a vent at the top of the furnace much like the flames can be controlled by the aperture of a chimney the fire that heated rebel's furnace was tempered by the size of the vent hole at the top of the oven which in turn was managed by the rising and falling rod creating a proper feedback loop as the temperature in the apparatus rose the increased pressure of the heated alcohol pushed up the mercury which in turn pushed up the rod creating a mechanical force that would close a damper and throttle down the fire conversely if the temperature in the apparatus fell below the desired level the alcohol pressure was reduced the mercury dropped and the mechanical linkage opened the damper drebel's apparatus gained the attention of several members of the royal society including robert boyle one of the fathers of modern chemistry and christopher wren the greatest english architect of his time yet despite his success drebel could never make enough money to make up for the lavish lifestyle of his wife treble passed away practically a poper in london on 7th of november 1633 after his death rebels apparatus was finally repurposed into an artificial egg incubator to hatch chickens perhaps in an attempt to prove that his machine could transmute inanimate matter into a living organism from today's point of view drebel's thermostat was a technological marvel his story shows us how feedback was instrumental to generate a ubiquitous device in our everyday lives and a paradigm shifting idea in the history of technology

## Governors

our final story today is about governors the early ancestors of modern cruise control ever since their invention at about the time of the american revolution governors have attracted the interest of many influential figures in science including james watt leon fuco and james clerk maxwell let's start by busting a myth james watt who is often credited with inventing the steam engine actually did not working steam engines had been on the job for decades before what ever saw one in 1763 watt was asked to repair a small scale model of an early working new common engine which belonged to the university of glasgow watt had been working for the university on maintaining and repairing scientific instruments since 1757 the new common engine barely worked even after every repair frustrated by the awkwardness of the engine watt set out to improve it after much experimentation watts demonstrated that on every cycle about three quarters of the thermal energy of the steam was being consumed in heating the engine cylinder what came up with this key innovation in may 1765 it dramatically improved the efficiency of the existing new common engine by separating the heating chamber from the cooling chamber however this innovation made his engine extremely powerful so powerful that this generated a new problem he needed some kind of speed regulating device to tame this unprecedented machine power again what turned to what already existed namely a clumsy centrifugal regulator invented by the english mechanic and miller thomas med med had invented a centrifugal regulator for a windmill that would lower the mealstone onto the grain only when the stone speed was sufficient at the time many famous british mechanical engineers began their careers as mill rights governors were indeed invented to protect millstones from excessive wear and tear and to produce flour of uniformly fine quality the idea behind matt's device was to measure the millstone's rotational speed through a whirling pendulum so as to adjust the area of the windmill sails through appropriate mechanical connections and to keep the wheel rotating at a desired speed centrifugal governors were immediately greeted with gratitude by james watt and his partner matthew bolton who at the time were pioneering the new technology of the steam engine watt and bolton were building a large mill later to be named the albion mill where the capabilities of their new rotary engine were to be demonstrated in may 1788 bolton found that a device similar to that invented by med had been installed at the albion mill bolton promptly sent a detailed and enthusiastic description of the device to what which probably sparked the eureka moment behind the invention of the first centrifugal governor by november of the same year watt and his colleagues had designed a centrifugal speed regulator and around the end of the year the first governor was installed on the lap engine curiously what did not file a patent application for the governor he considered the device merely an adaptation of the centrifugal pendulum to a new use however watt and bolton tried to protect their invention from competitors by keeping its existence secret in fact the first customers who ordered it were asked to hide the governor from public view however the device soon became well known within a few years after its invention it was recognized everywhere as a symbol of the steam engine it is reported that about 75 000 governors were used in britain around 1868. just 80 years after their invention theoretical investigation of governors started with the paper by maxwell in 1868 which is considered to be the origin of control theory maxwell's interest in governors reflected to some extent a contemporary vogue at the height of the industrial revolution the mechanism for controlling the speed of every steam engine was plagued by problems of instability maxwell's interest in governors was probably unrelated to their practical utility but originated from the desire to address the issue of their stability he analyzed linearized models finding that the stability of the closed-loop system could be determined by analyzing the roots of an algebraic equation maxwell also demonstrated the benefits of the integral action and derived a stability criterion for third order systems however he had to turn to his colleague edward routh who solved the general stability problem in 1877 since 1868 governors soon entered the textbooks and handbooks of engineering and inventors began to develop feedback devices in other areas of technology there is a funny anecdote here about maxwell and ralph ralph was one of the most famous and successful coaches at cambridge in the 19th century he had been a private tutor to more than 600 pupils between 1855 and 1888. he prepared the senior wrangler the top mathematics student at cambridge on 27 occasions ralph was himself senior wrangler in 1854 maxwell sat for the mathematical tripos in the same year and was placed second apparently maxwell was so confident of achieving first place himself that he did not travel to rise early to hear the list of successful candidates read out in the senate house but sent his servant instead on his return maxwell is said to have inquired well tell me his second and he was somewhat taken aback to receive the reply you are sir
